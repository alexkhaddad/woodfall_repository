Dataset Title: woodfall.csv

File format: comma delimited (.csv)
Description: 
  Contains species counts collected from wood-falls and information of logs. 
Geographic Information:
  Station Deadwood, Northeast Pacific Ocean (36.154098N, 122.40852W)
Data Key Words:
  Woodfall, Deep-Sea, Xylophaga, Xylophaginae, Diversity, Alpha Diversity, 
  Fisher's alpha
Data Collection Method:
  36 Acacia logs (0.6-20.6kg) were deployed 3203m deep over a 500m^2 area. Acacia logs
  were sewn into a synthetic 5mm mesh bag. After 5 years, 18 logs were retrieved and 
  placed in 300um mesh bags. Specimens were identified to lowest taxonomic level. 
Data Processing Methods:
  Logs were placed in a randomized block design.
